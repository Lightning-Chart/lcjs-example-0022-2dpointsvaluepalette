## Description

_2D points dynamic coloring by value palette_

This example showcases a new feature in LCJS v3.0.1 release - dynamic coloring of 2D points using a value palette.

Value palette coloring is a really powerful feature, which allows dynamic coloring based on any kind data set.

In this example it is used to color a data set based on Y distance from another data set.

In practice, this is done by calculating the Y difference and assigning a `value` property to each data point - naturally, there are endless different ways this can be used.

In addition to this, dynamic coloring by `x` or `y` coordinate is also supported. This is activated simply by setting the `PalettedFill.lookUpProperty` to either `'x'` or `'y'`.
